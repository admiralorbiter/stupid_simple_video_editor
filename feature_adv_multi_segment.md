# Advanced Multi-Segment Cut & Merge

This feature allows users to **remove multiple segments** (e.g., ads, dead space, or unwanted footage) from a single video clip and then automatically **stitch** the remaining parts together into one continuous output. Essentially, the user defines several start/end points for “segments to remove,” and the application merges all the “kept” portions in the final video.

---

## 1. Overview

- **Use Case**:
  - **Live stream highlights**: A streamer may want to remove 2-3 sections of downtime from a long recording.  
  - **Recorded events**: Cutting out coffee breaks or setup periods from a conference video.  

- **Key Benefit**: Eliminates the need to create multiple subclips manually and merge them later. Instead, the user marks the unwanted sections, and the tool produces one edited clip.

---

## 2. Workflow

1. **Load Video**  
   - User opens a video from the existing library or imports a new one.

2. **Mark Segments to Remove**  
   - The interface allows marking multiple `(start, end)` pairs of unwanted content.  
   - Visually highlight these segments on a timeline (if possible) or list them in a table.

3. **Review / Adjust**  
   - Users can add, delete, or modify these segments.  
   - (Optional) Provide a basic “Preview” function to see how the cuts flow together.

4. **Confirm & Process**  
   - Clicking “Finalize” or “Create Edited Clip” triggers a back-end process:
     - **FFmpeg** (or a similar approach) to remove the unwanted segments and stitch remaining footage.
   - The edited clip is saved as a new file.

5. **Result**  
   - The final merged clip appears in the user’s library or a “Clips” section.  
   - Metadata (clip name, file path, segments removed, creation date) is stored in the database.

## 3. Implementation Strategy

### 3.1 Data Model Updates
- Extend the existing structure to store multiple removal segments.  
  - For example:
    - **Option A**: Store a JSON list of segments `(start, end)` in a single field.  
    - **Option B**: Use a child table referencing each segment (e.g., `clip_segments`) if you want more flexibility.

### 3.2 UI / UX
- **Timeline & Segment Controls**:  
  - Let users add `(start, end)` pairs to a list or visually mark them on a timeline.  
  - Provide “Add Segment” and “Remove Segment” buttons or icons.  
- **Validation**:  
  - Check for overlapping segments or invalid input.  
  - Possibly highlight or color-code segments to remove.

### 3.3 FFmpeg Approach
- **Subclip & Concat Method**:
  1. Split the source video into multiple “kept” segments (i.e., everything that’s **not** in the removed segments) using `-ss` and `-to` in copy mode.  
  2. Use FFmpeg’s **concat demuxer** or **concat filter** to merge these partial clips into one final video.

- **Filter-Based Method**:
  - Construct a single FFmpeg filter graph that trims out unwanted sections and concatenates the rest in one pass. This can be more complex to implement but avoids generating intermediate files.

### 3.4 Performance Considerations
- **Copy Mode** (`-c copy`):
  - Fast if all segments share the same codec/container.  
  - Minimal re-encoding overhead.
- **Potential Re-encoding**:
  - If the video segments differ or if you need frame-accurate cuts, you might need to re-encode. This is more CPU-intensive.

### 3.5 Error Handling
- Check for:
  - Overlapping segments or out-of-range times.  
  - Resultant clip length of zero.  
- Provide user-friendly error messages or warnings.

### 3.6 Testing
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Parsing of multiple `(start, end)` segments.  
  - Validation logic for overlaps or invalid times.
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Ensure multiple segments are properly removed and the final stitched video is playable.  
  - Test with varied lengths and number of segments.

## 4. Sample Task Breakdown

1. **Database / Model**  
   - Implement a structure (JSON field or separate table) to store multiple segments for a single video/clip.  
   - Modify your `clips` table or add a new table (`clip_segments`) to hold `(clip_id, start_time, end_time)`.

2. **UI Enhancements**  
   - Add “Remove Segment” functionality in the video detail page.  
   - Provide a table or timeline to list segments: `(Start, End)`.  
   - Buttons to add, edit, or delete segment definitions.

3. **Back-End Logic**  
   - Create a new Flask route, e.g., `/clip/multi_remove` to handle the multi-segment removal.  
   - Parse the segment data from the request (e.g., JSON payload or form fields).  
   - Derive the “kept” segments, then generate FFmpeg commands accordingly.

4. **Stitching Method**  
   - **Subclip** each “kept” segment, writing temporary files: `part1.mp4`, `part2.mp4`, etc.  
   - Create a simple “concat list” file for FFmpeg:  
     ```
     file 'part1.mp4'
     file 'part2.mp4'
     ...
     ```
   - Run a second FFmpeg pass to merge them:  
     ```
     ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i mylist.txt -c copy final_output.mp4
     ```
   - Clean up temporary files.

5. **Result Storage**  
   - Insert a new record in `clips` for the final merged file, referencing the original video ID.  
   - Optionally store the segments removed in a JSON column or child table.

6. **Testing & Validation**  
   - Test with edge cases: removing segments at the very beginning or end, multiple short segments, etc.  
   - Verify the final output matches expectations (no leftover frames of removed content).

## 5. Summary

The **“Advanced Multi-Segment Cut & Merge”** feature expands beyond simple clipping by allowing users to define multiple segments to remove, thereby producing a single, fully merged clip that omits all unwanted footage. This is particularly valuable for streamers and other users who often need to cut out multiple intervals of downtime or irrelevant content from a single long recording.

By organizing segment data in the database, providing intuitive UI controls, and leveraging FFmpeg’s segmenting and concatenation capabilities, you can significantly enhance the tool’s functionality and user experience.
